<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a software developer because I am deeply fascinated by modern technology and its impact on our daily lives.
		Creating innovative and useful applications or websites excites me, especially when they can solve real-world problems or make people's lives easier.
		Software development offers continuous learning opportunities and the ability to turn ideas into reality, which is what motivates me the most.
